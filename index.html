                                Phew! Where do I even begin? Turning a new age feels so good, doesn't it? Fish! üòÖüòÖ
                                It's been quite the journey‚Äîrocky at times, yet still wonderful‚Äîand here you are, standing tall like the blessing you are.
                                You're truly one amazing human, so beautiful, caring, and lovely.
                                Your aura and simplicity are so charming, and I can't thank the heavens enough for the gift of you. 
                                Always remember, wherever the winds of life may blow, you'll always have me by your side this is my promise to you (and a man is only as good as his word).
                                You're unbelievably sweet, and I love the way you're passionate about everything that matters serving God, learning new things, family, and everything that brings out the beauty in you.
                                These are the things that make you unique, and I believe in you more than you know.
                                Even though you can be a bit annoying sometimes (üòÖ), I love you even more for it. Thank you for the impact you‚Äôve had on me‚Äîyour prayers, your love, your patience, your encouragement, your calls, and your kindness.
                                You've been my rock, and I'm so grateful for you.
                                Here's to many more beautiful moments and memories together.
